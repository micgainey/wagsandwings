          <strong>If you are boarding a dog, we will take 1 small animal at no charge. (rabbit, guinea pig, fish, mouse, inquire about any other animal)</strong>

          Cost of boarding will be determined by the weight of your dog.
        </li>
        <li>
          While your dog is boarding they will participate in daycare activities. Because of this, they will need to attend 1 half-day of daycare at least 2 weeks before boarding dates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since dogs have different dietary needs you will need to provide food portioned in individual ziplock bags for each meal. We also ask that you provide a feeding schedule that your pet is accustomed to.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your dog requires prescription medications, you bring it in a sealed container with detailed instructions on how to administer and store. (+$5.00 for each medication)
        </li>
        <li>
          No refunds for early pickup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We also have accommodations for dogs who are not socialized, please inquire for pricing and details.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Dogs that are boarding must adhere to all daycare policies.
