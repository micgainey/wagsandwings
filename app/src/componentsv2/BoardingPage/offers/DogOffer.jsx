        While your dog stays at Wags ‘n’ Wings, their days will be spent in our Day Care program. At night, they will stay in our spacious kennels with a cot style bed. You may bring bedding from home for a home away from home feel. Besides our interactive day care program, you may purchase additional activities to give them more stimulation.
