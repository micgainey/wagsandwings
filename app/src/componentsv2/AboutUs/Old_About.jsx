        My passion for animals is in my DNA. I grew up raising guppies, swordtails, and tropical fish. I fed pigeons at the park, and raised orphaned baby birds, and my first birdy love was a downed baby mynah named Oscar. My parents raised me to respect, nurture, and protect all animals, and my passion for animals is now being realized as I work to serve Oahu’s pet children. I can’t think of anything better.

        My husband Vernon…owner of Hawaii Home Repair and Maintenance is the force behind our quick build. His vision of a safe and usable space has come to life in the form of large comfortable kennels, safety measures to ensure pet and team safety, a ramp and kennel system to allow for safe integration into common areas, and an overall beautiful and useful space. He is the enabler of my rescue efforts, accompanying me on rescue missions, and using his Hawaiian Style throw net skills to catch ducks, or using the “bend and snatch” method to catch pigeons that no one else can LOL!

        My sons… Michael, Graduate of University of Hawaii Computer Science is using what he learned to build our Website, coordinate and implement our Gingr System, and will be responsible for our boarding guests, and setting our mornings up for success. Andrew, who will be completing his teaching degree at the University of Hawaii and entering into a Masters Program next year is my Marketing support spreading the word about our new journey to everyone he meets, and with his skills in health and exercise he keeps me in “check” ensuring that I eat right, and stretch often. And finally Ryan, a skilled fisherman, and sound system enthusiast, will be responsible for adherence to facilities maintenance procedures to ensure a clean and safe environment for all our precious guests!

        My brother Jon who supports us from SanFrancisco, CA used his skills in design and development to create my signs, business cards, uniforms, and print, all at a moment's notice.

        And last, but certainly not least Mom, Jeani, and Dad, Marvin… (The two who instilled my love for animals)… Mom is responsible for bringing to life the beauty of our space with inspirational signs, displays, room decor, and foliage. And Dad… is the one who cheers us on and makes sure no one here goes hungry!

        Our Wags ’n’ Wings Hawaii family believes that every animal matters… and along with our handpicked team members,  safety and fun is at the heart of what we do. We look forward to serving you!
