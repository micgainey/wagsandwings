            <p className='color-5'>There's nothing better than knowing that your pet is safe, and having fun while you are apart. Our Day Care program features flexible options ranging from all day play, to enrichment and interaction, private play for a more relaxed setting or for pets who arenâ€™t entirely social. We have tailored programs to accommodate them all. We have day care packages that offer discounts for multi-day purchases, and the option for half day and full day stays. Our location, in Halawa Valley, has easy access to HI, H2, and H3 making it a convenient location for all parts of our island. For the safety of your pet, we have holding areas for your pet to decompress before joining their friends in the common areas, and safeguards to ensure that your pet is NEVER left unattended. And to keep your pet cool and comfortable we have air-conditioning throughout, and water days and refreshing treats to cool off and have fun!</p>
